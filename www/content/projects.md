### OSU Security Club Discord Bot
This is a Discord bot to support the [OSU Security Club](https://www.osusec.org) Discord Server.

Features:
* Email verification upon joining the server
  * When a new user joins the server, the bot will message them and ask for their Oregon State email. Upon receipt, the bot will email them a token and wait to receive it, upon which the user will receive the `Member` role, allowing them to access more channels.
  * This is used to restrict access to sensitive/internal channels since the Discord invite link is publicly available on our website
* Role management
  * Users can add/remove roles relevant to what they are doing in the club
*
