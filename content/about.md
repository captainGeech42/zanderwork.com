### Education

Hello! My name is Zander Work, and I'm a senior studying Computer Science at [Oregon State University](https://www.oregonstate.edu/), focusing on security. I'm a member of [Dr. Yeongjin Jang\'s](https://www.unexploitable.systems/) research group ([SSH Lab](https://ssh.unexploitable.systems/)), focusing on software and systems security, and will be graduating from Oregon State in June 2021.

After I graduate from Oregon State, I'll be entering the [Security Studies Program](https://css.georgetown.edu/academics/ssp/) at Georgetown University.

### Work

Currently, I work as a security analyst at the [OSU Security Operations Center](https://uit.oregonstate.edu/ois) as an analyst on the network monitoring/CTI team, using tools such as Zeek, Splunk, Elastic, and Nessus. Previously, I've worked at:

* [FireEye, Inc.](https://www.fireeye.com) as a Technical Intelligence Intern on the Financial Crime team, analyzing malware and tracking new fincrime threats
* [Pacific Star Communications](https://pacstar.com/) as a Cyber Security intern, working on a variety of internal projects
* [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/) as a summer intern with [Dr. Wu-Chang Feng](https://thefengs.com/wuchang/) building CTFs as a tool for teaching cybersecurity.

Are you looking for a freelancer to support your cybersecurity projects? Contact me! I'm available for work.

### Hobbies

I'm the current CTF team lead and former president (2017-2020) of the [OSU Security Club](https://www.osusec.org/), where I've lead our CTF and CDC teams to many [impressive accomplishments](https://www.osusec.org/accomplishments/). I compete in a lot of CTF events with the club under the team [OSUSEC](https://ctftime.org/team/12858).

I also enjoy working on malware analysis and cyber threat intelligence research, which I'll occasionally publish [blog posts](/blog/) on.

To get away from the computer (apparently you are supposed to do this), I love going outside to enjoy nature, listening to music, and going bowling.
