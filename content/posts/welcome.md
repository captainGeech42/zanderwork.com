Welcome to my new site! Previously my "website" was just a redirect to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zanderwork/), but I decided it was time to do something different with it, and have a platform where I could share some of the cools things I'm working on that weren't appropriate for the [OSUSEC blog](https://www.osusec.org/blog/) or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zworksec).

This site is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an awesome static website generator written in Golang. If you're looking for a new way to make static sites, I'd definitely check it out. Super simple to get started with.
