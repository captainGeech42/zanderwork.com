_This is a part of a series of writeups for a malware challenge I made for DamCTF 2020. Please see [here](/blog/damctf-2020-malware/) for the overview._

## Phase 5

> Congratulations on exploiting the C2 server, you should be proud of yourself! You enabled the rest of your team to uncover a wealth of new intelligence on the malware, including what looks to be the operator panel for it! If you are able to compromise their panel, we'll be able to learn even more about these actors.
